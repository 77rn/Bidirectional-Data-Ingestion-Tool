1. Connect to ClickHouse Easily
Make a reusable setup that connects to ClickHouse using details (like host, port, username, and password) stored safely in .env files.

2. Dropdown to Pick Table Columns
In your React app, show a dropdown where users can select which columns they want to work with. This list should come from ClickHouse.

3. Wait Before Sending Backend Requests
If a user quickly changes their selection (table or columns), wait a bit before hitting the backend — so you don’t send too many unnecessary calls.

4. Preview Table Data
On the backend, create an API where you give a table name and the columns you want — and it sends back 100 rows from ClickHouse as a preview.

5. Secure with Login Tokens (JWT)
Protect all ClickHouse-related routes by checking if the user is logged in properly using a JWT token. If not, block access.

6. Read CSV Header Columns
Build a backend function that reads the first row (headers) of an uploaded CSV file and sends them back to the frontend.

7. Flexible Table View in React
Build a React component that shows any table data it receives, no hardcoding of column names or data structure.

8. Reset Data on Source Switch
In React, when a user changes between CSV and ClickHouse, clear all previews, columns, and files so there’s no confusion.

9. Organize Code Cleanly
Keep your client and server files neat. Use folders like routes, utils to separate different parts of your app.

10. Smart SELECT Query
Write backend logic that builds a SQL SELECT statement from the columns the user picked and only brings back 100 rows max.

11. Preview CSV Without Full Load
Read and show the first 100 rows of a CSV file using a stream without loading the whole file into memory.
